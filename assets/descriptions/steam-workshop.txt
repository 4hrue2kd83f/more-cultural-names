This is a mod for various strategy games, that makes province names change their name dynamically, to one that fits the culture of the faction that controls them.

It first started in 2016 for Crusader Kings 2 (with HIP), and grew ever since both in size and in game coverage.

In the common database [i](for all the supported games)[/i], there are currently [b]over 120.000[/b] names for [b]over 850[/b] languages, themes and time periods.

The names are meant to provide an immersive and authentic experience for the game's setting and time period.
However, if there are no names for a specific language for this context, names from other time periods, or even from very closely related languages, will be used instead, as long as they make sense and are a good fit.

The mod is [b]OS-agnostic[/b], which means that it will work on all of the operating systems supported by the game.

It is actively tested (and developed) on [b]Linux[/b], where it is guaranteed to work with either the native version of the game or through Steam Play.

It is also [b]save-game compatible[/b], and can be added and removed at will without breaking anything.
