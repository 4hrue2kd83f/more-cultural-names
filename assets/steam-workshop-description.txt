This is a mod for various strategy games, that adds new place names based on their culture/faction.

It first started in 2016 for Crusader Kings 2 (with HIP), and grew ever since both in size and in game coverage.

There are currently [b]over 65 thousand[/b] names for [b]over 500[/b] languages, settings and time periods, in the main common database.

The names are meant to provide an immersive and authentic experience for the game's setting and time period.
However, if there are no names for a specific language for this context, names from other time periods, or even from closely related languages, will be used instead, as long as it makes sense. Examples:
[list]
[*] If a Middle Welsh name is not set, the Old Welsh one will be used if it exists, or the modern Welsh otherwise
[*] If an Occitan name does not exist, the French one will be used
[*] Croatian, Serbian and Bosnian will also use each other as backups. Same goes for Czech and Slovak, etc...
[/list]
