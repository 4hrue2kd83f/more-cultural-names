This is a mod for various strategy games, that adds new place names based on their culture/faction.

There are currently [b]over 65 thousand[/b] names for [b]over 450[/b] languages, settings and time periods, in the main common database.

The names are meant to provide an immersive and accurate experience for the game's setting and time period.
However, if explicit names are not set for a specific language for a given time period, names from other time periods or related languages will be used instead, as long as it makes sense. Examples:
[list]
[*] If a Middle Welsh name is not set, the Old Welsh one will be used if it exists, or the modern Welsh otherwise
[*] If an Occitan name does not exist, the French one will be used
[*] Croatian, Serbian and Bosnian will also use each other as backups, and so will Czech and Slovak, etc...
[/list]

You can download the latest release from the [url=https://github.com/hmlendea/more-cultural-names/releases]GitHub page[/url] and extract the contents into the appropriate mod directory for your game.

Note: This mod gets updated more frequently on GitHub than on the Steam Workshop pages

[img=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmlendea/more-cultural-names/master/assets/banner_compatibility.png][/img]

The mod is [b]OS-agnostic[/b], which means that it will work on all of the operating systems supported by the game.

It is actively tested (and developed) on [b]Linux[/b], where it is guaranteed to work with either the native version of the game or through Steam Play.

It is also [b]save-game compatible[/b], and can be added and removed at will without breaking anything.
