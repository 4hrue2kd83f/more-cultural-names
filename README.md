# Installation

Just subscribe to the [Steam Workshop page](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1175098675) of this mod.

If you don't own the game on Steam, or you want to try the development version, you can download the latest release from the [GitHub page](https://github.com/hmlendea/ck2-hip-mcn/releases) and extract the contents into your "mod" directory alongside your current HIP installation.

**Note:** The mods are OS-agnostic, which means that they will work on all of the operating systems supported by the game

**UPDATING THE MOD:**
- If you own the game on Steam, it is recommended to subscribe to the Steam Workshop pages in order to benefit from automatic updates
- However, this mod gets updated more frequently on GIT than on the Steam Workshop pages

## Requirements

### Crusader Kings 2

- This mod requires up-to-date **HIP** with at least the **SWMH** module installed.
- Backwards-compatibility with older HIP versions is intended but not guaranteed.
- Also, this mod officially supports HIP with only the default modules installed, but it should work with any setup as long as SWMH is there.
