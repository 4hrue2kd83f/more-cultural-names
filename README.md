# Roadmap

The current development focus and roadmap can be found [here](https://github.com/hmlendea/more-cultural-names/wiki/Roadmap).

The mod grows continuously, and any new names added to it are automatically ported to all of the other supported games that can use it.

***Note**: This mod might get updated more frequently on GitHub than on the Steam Workshop*

# Compatibility

It is actively tested (and developed) on **Linux**, where it is guaranteed to work with either the native version of the game or through Steam Play.

It is also **save-game compatible**, and can be added and removed at will without breaking anything.
