# More Cultural Names for HIP

This is a submod for CK2's Historical Immersion Project that add new culture-specific names for titles, jobs and characters, with the focus being on landed titles.
This submod expects a standard HIP installation, with all the default modules installed, especially SWMH.

## Installation

Just copy the files into your mod folder inside the CK2 user data folder, alongside HIP.

## Development focus

Currently, the development is focues on the following areas:

1. Landed title names for your native language (you can start with neighbouring countries)
2. Missing HIP names for counties and baronies that both have the same name but only one (usually the county) has culture-specific names associated

## Development guidelines

1. Encode files with the `WINDOWS-1252` character set
2. Make sure the names you add are historically accurate for the medieval era
3. Do not override names already provided by HIP, unless you have a strong reason to do so
4. Check with the original HIP files and take note of the already existing names (especially for similar cultures) and the name displayed ingame (which might be very different from the internal name in the files, e.g. `d_galich` is Halych ingame)
5. Make sure there are no other dependancies than the default HIP modules. Do not add names for optional modules or other submods.
