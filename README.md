# More Cultural Names for HIP

This is a submod for CK2's Historical Immersion Project that add new culture-specific names for titles, jobs and characters, with the focus being on landed titles.

## Installation

Just copy the files into your mod folder inside the CK2 user data folder, alongside HIP.

## Contributions

You are welcome to bring any suggestion, feedback or modification to this project.

There are a few ways you can do so:
1. You can create git pull requests for this repository (This requires git knowledge)
2. You can create a new "[issue](https://github.com/HoratiuMl/CK2-HIP-MoreCulturalNames/issues)" for this project

You are encouraged to bring changes to the following areas:
1. Landed title names for exonyms of your native language (you can start with neighbouring countries)
2. Missing HIP names. There are cases where a county and barony have the same name, but only one of them (usually the county) has culture-specific names. There are also many cases where a name is the same in multiple similar cultures but only one of them is defined.

## Development guidelines

1. Encode files with the `WINDOWS-1252` character set
2. Make sure the names you add are historically accurate for the medieval era
3. Do not override names already provided by HIP, unless you have a strong reason to do so
4. Check with the original HIP files and take note of the already existing names (especially for similar cultures) and the name displayed ingame (which might be very different from the internal name in the files, e.g. `d_galich` is Halych ingame)
